;;; Commentary:
;;
;; English helper with company interface.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put company-english-helper.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'company-english-helper)
;;
;; And bind your key with function `toggle-company-english-helper'.
;;
;; If your computer's performance is good enough, you can enable fuzz search by:
;;
;; (setq company-english-helper-fuzz-search-p t)
;;

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET company-english-helper RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/12/01
;;      * Adjust the case of the completion word according to the string entered by the user.
;;
;; 2018/08/29
;;      * Add option `company-english-helper-fuzz-search-p' and turn off it default.
;;
;; 2018/08/27
;;      * Add fuzz search algorithm.
;;      * Make prefix-match-candidates as first candidates, then suffix-match-candidates and fuzz-match-candidates.
;;
;; 2018/08/10
;;      * Require `cl' avoid error "Symbol's function definition is void: remove-if-not".
;;
;; 2018/07/29
;;      * Calculate maximin length of match candidates dynamically.
;;      * Adjust require code place.
;;      * Adjust variable code place.
;;
;; 2018/07/20
;;      * Use `string-prefix-p' instead fuzz match, too many wrong candidates in completion result.
;;      * Use `company-grab-symbol' instead `company-grab-word' to fix that word "good-bye" can't completion, thanks et2010!
;;
;; 2018/07/06
;;      * First released.
