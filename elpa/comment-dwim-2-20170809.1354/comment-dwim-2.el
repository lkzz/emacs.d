;;
;; # Description
;;
;; This package provides a replacement for `comment-dwim', `comment-dwim-2',
;; which includes more comment commands than its predecessor and allows to
;; comment / uncomment / insert comment / kill comment / indent comment
;; depending on the context.  The command can be repeated several times to
;; switch between the different possible behaviors.
;;
;; # Demonstration
;;
;; Go to the github page to see an animated demonstration of the command.
;; https://github.com/remyferre/comment-dwim-2
;;
;; # How to use
;;
;; As the command is unbound, you need to set up you own keybinding first,
;; for instance:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-;") 'comment-dwim-2)
;;
;; # Customization
;;
;; Contrary to `comment-dwim', `comment-dwim-2' will by default kill an
;; inline comment if it encounters one when being repeated.  If you prefer
;; the `comment-dwim' behavior (which is to reindent the inline comment),
;; set comment-dwim-2--inline-comment-behavior to 'reindent-comment.
;;
;;   (setq comment-dwim-2--inline-comment-behavior 'reindent-comment)
;;
;; Whatever you choose between killing or reindenting, the other behavior
;; is still made available by calling `comment-dwim-2' with a prefix
;; argument.

;;; Code:
