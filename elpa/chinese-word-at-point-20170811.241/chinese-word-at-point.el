;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides two additional `chinese-word' and `chinese-or-other-word'
;; things to `thing-at-point' function.

;; Using:
;;
;; 1. Use (thing-at-point 'chinese-word) to get Chinese word at point
;; 2. Use (thing-at-point 'chinese-or-other-word) to get any possible word
;; (including Chinese) at point
;;
;; You can also use (chinese-word-at-point) and (chinese-or-other-word-at-point)
;; if you prefer.
;;
;; 3. use (chinese-word-chinese-string-p string) to test whether a string consists
;; of pure Chinese characters.
