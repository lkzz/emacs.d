# Snippets for Ruby Mode

## About

Comprehensive collection of Ruby snippets for
[yasnippet](http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/ "yasnippet - Google Code").
The collection also contains snippets for major Ruby frameworks like Rails
and RSpec.

The Rails snippets were originally borrowed from
[mknittig/yasnippet-rails](http://github.com/eschulte/yasnippets-rails/tree).

The RSpec snippets require that RSpec files are edited in a separate
Emacs mode. I recommend using
[rspec-mode.el](http://github.com/Chrononaut/rspec-mode.el/tree/master).
The RSpec snippets were originally borrowed from
[gary/yasnippets-rspec](http://github.com/gary/yasnippets-rspec/tree/master).

And much of the credits should naturally go to the yasnippet-rails and
yasnippet-rspec authors.

Thanks to Jeff Wheeler for his work on the snippet_copier.py script!
